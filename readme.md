# Orcas Christian School Lunch Survey
### Project inspired by FreeCodeCamp.org

At the school where I was a teacher for 3 years, they started a lunch program and asked me to make a survey for feedback after their pilot year.

In this project, I learned:
- How to design and structure an HTML from
- How to make a checkbox limiter in javascript
- How to use CSS grid with checkboxes and forms
